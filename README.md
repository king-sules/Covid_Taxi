# Covid_Taxi
The basis of this project is to review if Covid-19 had an effect on the popularity of taxi in NYC. We take into consideration the year 2020 and 2018. We also take into consideration the months during the lockdown, April and May, and the months when NYC had less restriction, August and September. We compare them with the same months in 201
